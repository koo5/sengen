You are in my way
This will cost €30
I make €100 a day
I may give up soon and just nap instead
That won't happen
I can only wonder if this is the same for everyone else
I miss you
I always liked mysterious characters more
You should sleep
I'm going to go
It is unfortunately true
No I'm not; you are
That's MY line
He's kicking me
Are you sure
Then there is a problem
Oh, there's a butterfly
Hurry up
It doesn't surprise me
It depends on the context
Are you freaking kidding me
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said
I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool
America is a lovely place to be, if you are here to earn money
I'm so fat
So what
I'm gonna shoot him
